# Text Analysis Toolkit

**Note: This is my first project! ðŸ˜Š**

This repository contains a Python toolkit for text analysis. It provides various functions and tools for processing and analyzing text data, including:

- Tokenization and sentence segmentation
- Text cleaning (lowercasing, stop word removal, punctuation removal)
- Lemmatization
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Sentiment Analysis
- Frequency Analysis
- Topic Modeling
- Dispersion Plots
- Word Cloud Generation

## Getting Started

To use this toolkit, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-analysis-toolkit.git

a.Install the required Python packages by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

b.Place your text files (e.g., "Syrian.txt" and "MyCountry.txt") in the root directory of the project.

c.Modify the main() function in text_analysis.py to process your specific text data and analysis tasks.

d.Run the script with the input file paths as arguments:
python text_analysis.py Syrian.txt MyCountry.txt

e.Explore the results, including charts, dispersion plots, and word clouds generated by the toolkit.

Usage
Here's a brief overview of how to use the functions provided by the toolkit:

read_book(file_path): Read and load your text data from the specified file.

perform_sentiment_analysis(): Analyze the sentiment of your text.

find_most_common_names(): Find the most common person names in the text.

create_name_frequency_chart(): Create bar charts of the most common names.

create_dispersion_plot(): Generate dispersion plots for specific words.

perform_topic_modeling_on_real_words(): Perform topic modeling on your text data.

create_word_cloud(): Create word clouds to visualize word frequency.
